    <h2>The Sourcetoad CTF (2021)</h2>
    <p>
        Finally! We completed our upgrade to Laravel 8!!
    </p>
    <p>
        We took this chance to abandon Whoops! (Thanks for the years of error tracking)
    </p>
    <p>
        We have now installed Ignition 2.5.1, which should help us with any issues we encounter
    </p>
    <p>
        We are trying to build a CTF, but we haven't yet hide the flag in a reachable area. Its still
        in the root filesystem at <kbd>/flag</kbd>.
    </p>
