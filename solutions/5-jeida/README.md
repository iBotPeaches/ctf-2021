* This challenge was the intro to understanding common image techniques to hide information
* For all images that are immediately visible. I try two things right out of the gate.
* I dump the EXIF information and I peek the trailer of the image in a hex editor for injected plaintext.
* So using [exiftool](https://linux.die.net/man/1/exiftool) and dumping the details of this image we see:

```
âžœ  exiftool llama.png

Megapixels                      : 3.0
```

* One key stands out `Software` which points to a Github.io page about steganography
* Another key looks interesting about `Comment` pointing to Google Chrome
* It must be hinting at using Google Chrome to go to that website.
