	<h2>The Sourcetoad CTF (2021)</h2>
	<p>
		Welcome to a CTF (Capture The Flag). Instead of competing in the real world chasing flags. We are looking to
		find digital flags in an increasingly difficult set of challenges.
	</p>
	<p>
		These challenges will primarily be in the field of web dev that we do commonly. It will just have a heavy twist
		of security attached.
	</p>
	<p>
		Patterns here will help us strive to produce secure software from day 1 from being able to learn how to exploit
		software to extract a flag.
	</p>
	<p>
		All flags will follow the same format of <code>TOAD{ThisIsTheFirstFlag}</code>. So the contents between the
		brackets is adaptable, but the prefix will be the same
